>user_tree_artocarpus_desc 'This is a large tree that has the largest fruit in the world. It is native to the Western Ghats but is now cultivated inmany others parts of the country.'
>user_tree_artocarpus_desc1 'Did you know that the jackfruit is the largest edible fruit in the world? And did you know that the largest land mammal the elephant likes this fruit very much? 
                            <br /><br />
                            The jackfruit tree has been known from the beginning of historical times. The Greek historian Theophrastus writing about 300 B.C. says "There is also another tree which is very large and ha s wonderfully sweet and large fruit: it is used for food by the sages of India..." 
                            <br /><br />
                            This tree is believed to be a native of the Western Ghats and is cultivated in other parts of the country.'

>user_tree_mimusops_desc1 'The scientific name of this tree \'elengi\' is the same as this trees name in Malayalam. Actually the great Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus who created the modern system of naming trees selected the Malayalam name as the scientific name for this tree. Isn\'t that great to know? 
			  <br /><br />
			  This tree is also called the Bulletwood tree in English because the wood of this tree is one of the strongest available and has been traditionally used for building houses and bridges, boats, supports in mines etc. The other parts of the tree also have many uses. The small fruits are sweet and edible, the flowers are very fragrant and have been traditionally used to create perfumes and the oil from the seeds is used as cooking oil and for lighting lamps.'

>user_tree_cadamba_desc1 'This tree is often mistaken for the tree that is associated with Brindavan and with lord Krishna. The real \'Krishna Kadamb\' is a tree that is called Kaim in Hindi and which has flowers very like this Kadamb tree but is a native of the hot dry areas near Brindavan and grows very well there. In fact the people of Brindavan call the Kaim tree as \'Kadamb\'. Now the tree we are calling Kadamb needs a lot of water and will die of thirst if we plant it near Brindavan. 
                        <br /><br />
			Ok, now let us talk about our Kadamb. 
                        <br /><br />
                        The ball shaped, delicately scented, orange flowers are used by women to decorate their hair and are offered in prayer in Hindu temples. The fruit has a flavor that is relished by monkeys and bats and birds that also help to disperse the small seeds. The wood is very soft and is only good to create matchsticks and plywood.'

>user_tree_syzygium_desc1 'The most important fact, that you already know, about this tree is that you cannot eat the fruit without others finding out about it. Your mouth and tongue gets stained blue. So be careful when you are picking fruit from trees belonging to people who don't like children. But eating this fruit is good because it is used in medicines to cure diabetes, dysentery and for strengthening the teeth and gums. The leaves bark and seed are also used to create traditional medicines. The reddish-brown wood is heavy and is used extensively. This wood is water-resistant so finds use in outdoor and underwater structures.'

>user_tree_ficus_desc1 'In some parts of India there is a legend that under every country fig there runs a hidden stream. There may be some justification for this legend because this tree naturally grows near streams and ponds and is not found at all in the arid parts of our country. 
			<br /><br />
                        Most parts of this tree are used in traditional healing. Including something that may interest you very much. A lotion made from the bark of this tree is said to heal deep wounds made by the claws of a� TIGER. Although let\'s hope that you do not get a chance to use this piece of information. 
                        <br /><br />
                        The wood of this tree is very soft and is not of much use except that this is one of the woods prescribed in the Hindu scriptures for the sacrificial fire.'

			       The bark and leaves of the tree have medicinal properties.

>user_tree_phyllanthus_desc1 'The Amla grows wild in forests in most parts of India. The fruit contains 20 times the quantity of vitamin C as orange juice. In Ayurveda it is very highly respected as a miracle drug for many ailments. It is one of the three components of the \'triphala\'. Do you want to know what ailments Amla is supposed to cure? OK here is the list. 
			     <br /><br />
			     Jaundice, stomach disorders, coughs, dyspepsia, dysentery, enlarged liver, biliousness, hemorrhoids� The list goes on and on with more and more complicated names. Isn\'t that a miracle fruit then? 
			     <br /><br />
			     Do you know why the sourness of the Amla turns to sweetness in your mouth? This is because of a chemical reaction that the Amla juice undergoes when it mixes with the saliva in your mouth.'

>user_tree_ficus_desc1 'Here is an interesting story about this tree whose leaves shake wildly and make a lot of noise at the slightest wind. 
			<br /><br />
                        It is said that Gautama Buddha became enlightened meditating under one of these trees in Bodh Gaya in Bihar. Before the original tree died a small part of it was taken and transplanted in the capital of the Sri Lankan kings in 288 BC and was guarded day and night for 1300 years before the shifting of the capital to another location made people forget about this tree and it got covered by dense jungle for many centuries. In the 20th century the lost city and the still living were discovered and became accessible to pilgrims. So this 'Maha Bodhi tree' is over 2000 years old. Imagine what it must have seen and experienced? 
                        <br /><br />
                        The Peepal is also a highly revered tree for Hindus and its many parts find use in many Ayurvedic medicinal preparations.'

>user_tree_mangifera_desc 'Who doesn't know the mango tree, famed in folk stories and for the flavour of its delectable fruit? There are many hundreds of varieties of mango in India.'
>user_tree_mangifera_desc1 'Mango is the best fruit in the world. We don\'t know who said that but don\'t you agree? Two immediate points about the Mango that stand out can be easily found out. First- \'Indica\' in its scientific name refers to the fact that everybody in the world knows that this wonderful fruit is an Indian fruit. And second- Its English name \'Mango\' probably comes from the Malayalam and Tamil word maanga. 
			  <br /><br />
			  The wild mango has a lot of fibre which makes it not much fun to eat, so in India the mango has been cultivated over centuries into the various varieties that we have today that are tasty and without fibre. Some people estimate that there are over 500 varieties of mangoes grown in India. How many have you tasted? 
			  <br /><br />
			  One of the largest Mango trees in India is in Chandigarh. If you and your friends are 5 feet tall then it will take 
			  <br /><br />
			  30 children like you to hold hands to go around the trunk of this tree and when the sun is overhead it will take 100 children to go around the shadow of its crown. And it is supposed to give 10000 to 25000 fruits every year. Does that sound unbelievable? You may want to go to Chandigarh when the fruits of this tree are ripening and count how many there are and perhaps to eat as many as you can.'

                        The name rain tree may have come for either of the two reasons below. 
                        <br />
                        1. Tiny cicadas (do you know how such small insects can make such a loud noise?) that feed on the leaves of the tree give out a dew-like discharge that makes the ground under the tree wet 
                        <br />
                        2. The leaves fold in rainy weather and in the evening

>faq_q_monitor_every 'Q: Do we need to monitor every one of the 25 species of trees?'
>faq_a_monitor_every 'A: No. Only whatever trees from the list of 25 that are easily accessible for observation in or near the school or the child's home.'
>faq_q_how_many_trees 'Q: How many trees do we monitor?'
>faq_a_how_many_trees 'A: As many as you can from the list of 25.This could have more than one individual from a species. So you can monitor 3 plavus by giving them unique identification numbers and nicknames.'
>faq_q_school_compound_trees 'Q: We have no trees in the school compound so how do we go about monitoring trees?'

>faq_q_difference_fresh_leaves 'Q: How do we tell the difference between \'few\' and \'many\' fresh leaves?'
>faq_a_difference_fresh_leaves 'A: The terms 'few' and 'many' have the same meanings that they have in English. However to avoid confusion, they are quantified as per a simple rule. If more than 1/3rd of the branches of the tree have even one fresh leaf each, then it is approximated as \'many\' else as \'few\'. This same logic is applied to flowers and fruits as well.'
>faq_q_monitor_during_holidays 'Q: How do we monitor the trees during the summer holidays when the school is closed?'
>faq_a_monitor_during_holidays 'A: It takes only 5 minutes, once a week to monitor each tree. This could be arranged with the help of children even during the holidays. You could also take the help of people who take care of the schools during the holidays etc. Anyone can be easily taught how to do the weekly tree observations. SEED coordinators need to come up with creative methods to ensure this happens and to share it with the larger SEED community in Kerala.'
>faq_q_monitor_tall_trees 'Q: How do we monitor tall trees that we cannot see the top of? What if the new leaves or buds are coming first on top of the tree?'
>faq_a_monitor_tall_trees 'A: One way is to use a pair of binoculars if they are available. If this is not possible then it is advisable to choose trees in which the top parts of the tree canopies are clearly visible.'

>readmore_a_participate_desc1 'The six broad steps for the SEED schools to take part in SeasonWatch are detailed out below'
>readmore_a_participate_q1 'Choose trees'
>readmore_a_participate_a1 'Look for a mature, healthy, undamaged trees from the list of 25 that is growing in the school compound or nearby. It is good to monitor trees that are known to have flowered over more than one year. The trees could be on the roads outside the school or even in the homes of the children who are going to monitor them.'
>readmore_a_participate_q2 'Identify the trees, give them sequence numbers and nicknames'
>readmore_a_participate_a2 'As a first step to begin the process of monitoring trees, each tree needs to be identified correctly. This is easy for the more common trees in the list like maavu and plavu and thekku but may become difficult for some of the less common ones like mullilavu or ilippa. The SEED coordinators are given a tree identification booklet which has sketches of the leaves and flowers and fruits of all the 25 trees to make this process easy. Even if you haven�t received this, you can get trees identified by speaking to the local woodworkers or ayurvedic practitioners or  people in the locality who are interested in nature. 
			<br /> Once a tree is identified it needs to be numbered and given a nickname. The numbers are in the format 001, 002, 003 etc. and the nicknames are simple easy to remember names like �maavu near main gate� or �plavu in front of office� etc. More than one individual of a particular species can be monitored or a single sample of as many trees that the children have easy access to can be monitored. It is not necessary to monitor trees from all the species. For example the trees being monitored in a school could be- 3 maavus, 2 plavus, 1 uppila, 1 rain tree, 1 elengi, 1 mullumurikku and 2 thekkus.'
>readmore_a_participate_q3 'Assign children to trees'
>readmore_a_participate_a3 'Once the trees are selected and identified and numbered, children are assigned to monitor the trees. If there are 10 trees and 20 children, 2 children could be assigned to monitor each of the trees or if there are 30 trees and only 10 children, 1 child could be assigned 3 trees to monitor. This arrangement is completely up to the SEED coordinator.'
>readmore_a_participate_q4 'Note down some features of the tree'
>readmore_a_participate_a4 'To begin monitoring a tree only a correct identification, a number and a nickname are sufficient. However it is worth noting down some features as additional data. This could include the height of the tree, its girth, the direction and angle of the slope that it is standing on etc. When you add the tree on the website, there is a form there where you can see what additional information needs to be collected for each tree. You can do this later.'
>readmore_a_participate_q5 'Observe the tree'
>readmore_a_participate_a5 'The trees need to be observed once every week. The children need to go once a week to the trees that they are monitoring and look carefully at what changes have happened to the flowers and fruits and leaves on the trees. Observing the trees and noting down the changes is the central component of the SeasonWatch project so it is dealt with in more detail in the next sections of this article.'

>readmore_a_participate_a6 'The primary data for SeasonWatch is collected on a simple form in a tree observation book (also shown in the figure below). However for the data to become available nationally for comparison and analysis it needs to be sent to a central database that is accessible from all parts of the country. This is possible through this SEED-SeasonWatch. The website allows a user to add a tree and to add observations to it. It also has all the material that is given as booklets to the SEED coordinators. The weekly observation data can also be submitted through SMS, but this facility is not ready yet.'

Fresh leaves are newly emerged leaves that have not yet reached the size or colour of mature leaves. Are there caterpillars eating the leaves? Fill in the data. (Select 'None' if you are sure that there are no fresh/ mature leaves. Select 'few' if = 1/3rd of the branches have at least one fresh/mature leaf. Select \'many\' if > 1/3rd of the branches have at least one fresh/mature leaf. Select \'don\'t know\' if you are unable to observe clearly or if you forgot to check the tree.'
>readmore_a_observe_step5 '<strong>Step 5:</strong> Observe the flowers on the tree. Look for both buds and open flowers. Buds are defined by their petals not being opened fully. Note if there are bees or butterflies sipping nectar. In the sample observation shown in the figure the tree had no buds and had a few open flowers. And there were bees and butterflies on these flowers. The meaning of few is the same as the one that is defined for leaves.'

Unripe fruits are those that have not reached the size and colour of ripe fruits. Note if there are birds or monkeys eating the fruits. In the sample observation in the figure there were a few unripe fruits and no ripe fruits.'
